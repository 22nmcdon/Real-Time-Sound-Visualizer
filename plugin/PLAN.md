# Becoming a plugin

The instrument as a VST3 and AU plugin (and a standalone app), with the page as
its UI. Decided: **one C++ core, shared.** The sound engine and, in time, the
brain are written once in C++, built natively for the plugin and to WebAssembly
for the website, and the page becomes the UI for both. The website on GitHub
Pages goes on working throughout; nothing here may break it.

## Why the brain has to move, not only the engine

A standalone app could keep the brain in the page - the modulation matrix, the
sources, the keyboard's notes, the arpeggiator, the score, the fade envelopes,
presets - and send the engine the same one message a frame that the page sends
its worklet now. A plugin cannot. A host closes the plugin's window whenever it
likes, and closing it destroys the web view: everything the page runs stops,
and a patch that should go on playing in the host's timeline goes silent. So in
the plugin the page is a view of state held in C++, and a closed window
changes nothing about the sound.

That is most of the logic in `web/scope.html`, which is why the shared core
matters: two brains, one in JavaScript for the site and one in C++ for the
plugin, would drift apart in the way the README records again and again. One
brain, compiled twice, cannot.

## The boundary

```
  the page (UI)  <-- state snapshots, picture frames --  core (C++)
                 --- commands: set, patch, load, note -->  engine + brain
```

- **The page** draws and edits. It no longer owns state: it asks the core to
  change something and redraws from what the core says. In the browser the core
  is WebAssembly in the worklet; in the plugin it is native, behind JUCE.
- **The picture** is drawn by the page from sample windows the core hands over:
  in the plugin through JUCE's resource provider (`/picture.bin`, binary, one
  fetch a frame), in the browser straight from the worklet.
- **The picture's own sources** - the phosphor grid, the photocell, the picture
  meter - move into the core too, since they drive the sound and must go on
  when the window is closed.

## Stages

**0. The spike** (this commit). A JUCE plugin that builds on Linux here, loads
the page from inside its binary, plays notes through the first ported piece of
the core, and serves the samples it played for the page to draw. And the method
the port lives by: `core/tests/parity.py` holds each ported piece to the page's
own JavaScript, sample for sample. Still to do in the spike: the page drawing
from `/picture.bin` when it finds itself in the plugin, and a measured frame
rate for that path (the page alone draws at about 60 fps in the web view).

**1. The engine.** `makeGeneratorCore` (about 1,900 lines) to C++: voices and
layers with their pushes, the voice's oscillator, shaping and filter, drawbars,
wavetables and drawn cycles, the harmonograph and the solids, the plane, the
delay and chorus, the quantiser, the governor. Each piece held to the page by
the parity harness before the next is started, with scenarios written so the
fixture can show the effect.

**2. The brain.** The modulation matrix and every source, the fade envelopes,
notes, layers, the arpeggiator, the score, the clock (the host's transport in
the plugin), presets and setup codes as the core's state. The host's automation
gets a curated set of parameters - the macros, the morph position, the main
knobs - rather than every control.

**3. The page as a view.** One adapter in the page: the worklet and the
WebAssembly core in a browser, JUCE's bridge in the plugin. The web suite goes
on testing the page against the browser build.

**4. The picture's sources in the core,** so the loops go on with the window
closed.

**5. The site on WebAssembly.** The worklet runs the compiled core, and the
JavaScript engine and brain are retired once parity says there is nothing left
they do that the core does not.

**6. Release.** macOS AU and VST3, signed and notarised; Windows VST3 with
WebView2 linked statically; state saved into the host's project; recording
redone natively or left out.

## Found on the way

- **JUCE 8.0.9's Linux web view could not serve the page.** It runs WebKit in
  a child process and passes each resource over a pipe, reading without
  blocking; a message bigger than the pipe's buffer arrived in pieces, the
  reader dropped the first piece at the first gap, and read the next as a
  length - `std::bad_alloc` a few seconds after the window opened. JUCE fixed
  the reader later; the plugin is pinned to 8.0.15. (Tags sorted as text put
  8.0.9 last, which is how the old one was chosen.)
- **WebKitGTK read the page as Latin-1** through JUCE's custom scheme whatever
  the page's meta or the Content-Type said. The markup was unharmed, being
  ASCII with entities; the script's forty-odd other characters were not. The
  plugin serves the page as pure ASCII (`asciiPage`): escapes in the script,
  entities in the markup. The site's file is unchanged.
- **The envelope ported bit for bit.** The same scenarios through
  `makeEnvelope` and `scope::Envelope` differ by exactly nought, not merely by
  less than the 1e-12 allowed. One of the mutants tried on it cannot be caught
  by any scenario: the one-sample floor on a stage's time, because a stage's
  pole is built to land on its end in exactly that many steps, so any shorter
  time overshoots and is clamped to the same value. The scenario says so.

## Building and testing

```
python3 core/tests/parity.py                 # the core against the page
cmake -S plugin -B plugin/build -G Ninja [-DSCOPE_JUCE_DIR=/path/to/JUCE]
cmake --build plugin/build
plugin/build/ScopeShellTest_artefacts/Release/ScopeShellTest
```

On Linux the web view needs WebKitGTK 4.1 and GTK 3, and the standalone ALSA:
`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libasound2-dev`, with the X11 and
freetype headers JUCE asks for.
