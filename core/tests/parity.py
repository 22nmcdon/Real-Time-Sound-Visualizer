"""The C++ core against the page's JavaScript, sample for sample.

The core is a port of code that already works and is already tested
(web/tests), so the test that matters is not whether the C++ is reasonable
but whether it is the SAME: the same scenario through `makeEnvelope`, read
out of web/scope.html itself, and through scope::Envelope, compared a sample
at a time. A copy of the JavaScript kept here would be a second thing to
drift, so the runner lifts the function from the page by name.

Held to 1e-12 rather than to equality. The two agree on every operation's
order, but `Math.exp` and `Math.log` are V8's and `std::exp` and `std::log`
are the C library's, and the two are allowed to differ in the last place.

Null tests, as the web suite has them: the same comparison against the page's
values shifted by one sample, and against a run with one tone value changed,
must both fail - a comparison that could not tell those apart would pass
whatever the port did.
